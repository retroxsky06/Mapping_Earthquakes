# Mapping Earthquakes
Module 13 Challenge

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to create visualizations of earthquake data from Mapbox API.  The earthquakes shown are in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth.  They are represented by various circles sizes and colors, in which  the higher the magnitude of the earthquake, the bigger the circle size and the darker the color.

### Deliverables
- Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
- Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
- Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

## Software & Resources
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- VS Code
- Leaflet.js
- Mapbox API

## Earthquake Map
The interactive map allows users to toggle between three map views: Street, Satellite, and Dark Mode.  Additionally, users are able to choose the type of data that will be displayed, such as showcasing all earthquake data and/or earth's tectonic plates.
